# Winpepper Manual Test Plan

## Smoke checklist (per release)

- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Hotkey records / stops on press / release
- [ ] Transcript appears in the focused window
- [ ] Cancel hotkey aborts a session cleanly
- [ ] Settings persist across restarts (Plan 3+)
- [ ] Models tab downloads and verifies (Plan 4+)
- [ ] MSI install / upgrade / uninstall (Plan 6+)

## VM bootstrap

If working on a fresh machine:

1. Set up the dockur Windows VM (see `~/.claude/skills/windows-vm/SKILL.md`).
2. From the repo root: `./scripts/winssh < scripts/provision-vm.ps1`.
3. Verify: `./scripts/winrun "dotnet --version"` returns `9.0.x`.
4. Download the Parakeet model: `./scripts/winssh < scripts/download-parakeet.ps1`.

## Plan 1 walking-skeleton smoke (real Windows machine)

The dockur VM has neither a real microphone nor a real desktop session — `WasapiCapture` returns silence and `SetWindowsHookEx` may not deliver hotkey events. For an honest "hold and dictate" demo, run on a physical Windows 11 host with a working mic.

On the real Windows machine:

1. Clone the repo and check out `plan-1/foundation` (or main once merged).
2. Run `scripts/provision-vm.ps1` (it works on a real machine too — installs .NET 9, Git, VS Build Tools if missing).
3. Run `scripts/download-parakeet.ps1`.
4. Build the CLI: `dotnet build src/Winpepper.Cli/Winpepper.Cli.csproj -c Release`.
5. Run it: `dotnet run --project src/Winpepper.Cli -c Release`.
6. Hold **Right Ctrl + Right Shift** for ~2 seconds while speaking, then release.
7. Expected log sequence in the console:
   - `State Idle -> Recording`
   - `Captured <N> samples (<seconds>s)`
   - `State Recording -> Transcribing`
   - `Transcript: '<your words>'`
   - `State Transcribing -> Injecting`
   - `State Injecting -> Idle`
8. The transcript text should appear in whatever window had focus when you released the hotkey.

Acceptance bar for Plan 1: all four state transitions log, transcript is non-empty for clear speech, text appears in the focused window.

## Headless VM smoke (limited, what CI actually runs)

On the dockur VM you can still verify:

- Build: `./scripts/winrun "dotnet build"`.
- Tests excluding Windows-only integration: `./scripts/winrun "dotnet test --filter 'Platform!=Windows'"`.
- Parakeet load + decode against a synthetic tone: `./scripts/winrun "dotnet test --filter 'FullyQualifiedName~ParakeetSessionIntegrationTests'"`. This proves the ONNX model loads, the encoder runs, and the TDT decode loop completes without throwing. The transcript text itself will be empty/garbage for a pure tone, which is fine.
- Avoid `./scripts/winrun "dotnet test"` without a filter — `Hook_Installs_And_DisposesCleanly` hangs in headless environments.
